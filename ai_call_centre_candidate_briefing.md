# AI-Driven Call Centre System  
## Candidate Briefing: Practical Task – Build a Simple Web App

---

### 🧪 Objective

Your task is to build a simple web application using **Replit**, **Python**, and **Flask** that allows a user to submit a complaint and receive a short summary. The summary will be generated by an **online service** (API) that analyses the complaint text.

You are not expected to know how to do this in advance. We want to see how you explore, learn, and approach unfamiliar challenges.

---

### 📋 What Your App Should Do

1. Show a web form where a user can type in a short complaint (1–2 sentences).
2. Send the complaint text to an online API that responds with a brief summary.
3. Display the summary to the user.
4. Keep a list of all submitted complaints and their summaries (even just on the page).

Your app doesn't need to be beautiful or complex. The goal is to simulate how a basic AI-driven system might work.

### 🌐 The API You Must Use

You must call the following URL to obtain the summary of each complaint:

```
https://ernasparkcomplaintstest.ddns.net/api/testapi?payload=Your+complaint+text+here
```

- Replace `Your+complaint+text+here` with the complaint text (spaces become `+` or are URL-encoded).
- The response will be a **plain text summary**, like:

  ```
  Summary: The complaint appears to relate to delayed payments.
  ```

- The API returns standard HTTP responses. If something goes wrong (e.g. the complaint is missing), it may return an error like `400 Bad Request`.

### 🛠 Tools You’ll Use

- **Replit** – an online programming environment: [https://replit.com](https://replit.com)
- **Python** – the programming language
- **Flask** – a small web framework for Python
- **HTML** – for the user interface
- **The API above** – to simulate AI-based complaint summarisation

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Log in to [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) (create a free account if needed).
2. Create a new project using the **Flask** template.
3. Explore how to:
   - Create a simple web form
   - Handle form input in Flask
   - Send a request to an API from Python
   - Display the API’s response
   - Keep a list of complaint+summary pairs

You’re encouraged to use Replit’s built-in AI assistant (“Ghostwriter”), search online for examples, and experiment freely.

---

### 📦 What to Submit

By the end of the test period, please send us:

1. The link to your Replit project
2. A short explanation (in a `README.md` file or comment) that tells us:
   - What your app does
   - How you used the API
   - What challenges you faced
   - What you’d add or improve next

### ✅ What We’re Looking For

| Skill                    | Assessed Through                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Problem Solving          | Making the app work with minimal guidance  |
| Resourcefulness          | Searching, learning, trying new things     |
| Learning Agility         | Picking up new tools like Flask and APIs   |
| Communication            | Explaining your approach in plain English  |
| Creativity               | How you implemented or styled your solution|

You’re not expected to know everything already. This is about how you learn and think under light pressure.

---

### 💡 Final Tips

- Break the problem into small steps.
- Use online tutorials, examples, and Replit's help tools.
- Don't aim for perfect—aim for working and understandable.
- You’re welcome to add extra features, but the basic version is fine too.

We’re excited to see what you create. Good luck!
